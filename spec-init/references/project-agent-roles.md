# Project Agent Role Templates

Use these definitions when `spec-init` creates project-level roles. The source of truth is the neutral `.agents/roles/` role definition; Claude Code and Codex files are runtime adapters generated from the same role.

## Common Protocol

- Role definitions are project-scoped. Do not create user-global agents unless the user explicitly asks.
- TeamLead is the current main agent. Do not create a TeamLead subagent.
- Skill is the working method. Role is the workflow identity.
- Cross-role communication goes through TeamLead by default. A role may name intended downstream recipients in its output, but it must not assume direct agent-to-agent messaging.
- Role instances should remain resumable during one Spec run when the runtime supports agent threads. If a role thread is unavailable, restart the same project-level role and rebuild context from persisted Spec artifacts.
- Runtime handles for spawned role instances must be recorded in the current Spec's `lead/team-context.md` by TeamLead. Treat `agent_id`, `thread_id`, and `session_id` as runtime-local handles, not durable role identities.
- TeamLead owns the structure and control-plane sections of `lead/team-context.md`: frontmatter, run path, runtime handles, artifact registry, gate decisions, handoffs, blockers, and next action.
- All roles may directly maintain the shared completion sections in `lead/team-context.md`: `Task Progress` for their own completed work, and `Problem Resolution Log` for issues they found or resolved. Do not edit other roles' rows.
- Non-Lead roles must not edit any other `lead/team-context.md` sections. They return control-plane changes, handoff requests, and blocker updates to TeamLead.
- If hooks are configured, they must follow `.agents/hooks/team-context-hook-contract.md`: hooks record factual events only, while TeamLead and roles remain responsible for workflow semantics.
- Required state must be written to `spec/`, `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/rules/`, `.agents/skills/`, or the explicit experience/knowledge store. Do not rely on hidden agent context for workflow correctness.
- Each role writes its own artifacts under the current Spec role directory: `lead/`, `explorer/`, `writer/`, `tester/`, `executor/`, `debugger/`, `reviewer/`, `updater/`, or `ender/`.

## Neutral Role File Format

Create one file per role under `.agents/roles/<role-id>.md`:

```markdown
---
role_id: spec-explorer
required_skill: spec-explore
activation: TeamLead starts the role for the current Spec run.
communication: TeamLead-mediated
---

# spec-explorer

Purpose, inputs, outputs, and role rules.
```

## Runtime Adapter Rendering

Claude Code project adapter path: `.claude/agents/<role-id>.md`

```markdown
---
name: <role-id>
description: <one-line role purpose and when TeamLead should use it>
---

You are <role-id> in the R&K Flow Spec workflow.
Read `.agents/roles/<role-id>.md` and follow the referenced `<required_skill>` protocol.
Return results to TeamLead only, with artifact paths and any requested downstream handoff.
```

Codex project adapter path: `.codex/agents/<role-id>.toml`

Codex identifies a custom agent by the TOML `name` field. Use snake_case for
the Codex runtime name (`<codex-agent-name>`, computed by replacing `-` with
`_`, for example `spec-explorer` -> `spec_explorer`) while keeping the neutral
role id and file paths hyphenated. This mirrors the official Codex examples and
avoids ambiguity when asking Codex to spawn a role by name.

```toml
name = "<codex-agent-name>"
description = "<one-line role purpose and when TeamLead should use it>"

developer_instructions = """
You are <role-id> in the R&K Flow Spec workflow.
Read `.agents/roles/<role-id>.md` and follow the referenced `<required_skill>` protocol.
Return results to TeamLead only, with artifact paths and any requested downstream handoff.
"""
```

Also create `.codex/config.toml` if absent, or merge these settings if safe:

```toml
[agents]
max_threads = 7
max_depth = 1
```

Codex CLI note: `/agent` shows active spawned agent threads. It is not a
library view of all files under `.codex/agents/`. To verify discovery, ask
Codex explicitly to spawn a project agent such as `spec_explorer`, then inspect
the active thread with `/agent`.
